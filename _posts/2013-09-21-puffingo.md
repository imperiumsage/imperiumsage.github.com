OVERVIEW

PuffinGo allows groups to plan travel better. You create groups of friends and we find out common likes and dislikes We then use this information to narrow down group travel choices for you. 

Plug in the group you want to go with, the trip length and the per person budget and we will show you through a beautiful UI the best plans to pick and put to a vote among your friends. 

Once you select a winner, we help you book it for everyone.
