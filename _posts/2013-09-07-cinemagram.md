#OVERVIEW

Cinemagram is a native Android app which motivates movie buffs to step outside and explore locations filmed in old movies.

* The user gets an opportunity to recreate and try to emulate old movie scenes, by using photo editing abilities built in the app.
* The user can submit the edited photo in a contest or do it for the pure joy of it.
* The user can add the movies to his / her Netflix Instant queue as a reward for hiking all the way to those locations and enjoy the movie afterwards - reminiscing the location scenes.

Future work could be integrating Fitbit or Runkeeper as a way to measure how much active the user has been in the process and giving out vintage badges relevant to the movie era.
