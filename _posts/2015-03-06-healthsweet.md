#OVERVIEW

We pull in data from the Phillips HealthSuite Cloud platform's FHIR api and sentiment scores from connected social media accounts to gauge wellness. Our decision engine identifies adverse events (specified by pre configured business rules) and sends a quick survey to patients to augment health suite information. This information can be used by care providers, instantly (so as to take immediate action) as well as looked at on a longitudinal basis to improve care. 

More details on the tech in the demo below.

Our app won 5th place at the Philips HealthSuite Hackathon 2015.
